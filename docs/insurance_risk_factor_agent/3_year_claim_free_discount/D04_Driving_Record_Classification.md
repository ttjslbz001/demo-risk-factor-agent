D04 Driving Record Classification 
Chargeable Period for Points Assignment - The Chargeable Period for Points Assignment is the 35- 
month period prior to current policy term inception or the date on which the driver is added to the 
policy, whichever is later. 
 
Accident and Violation Evaluation Period - The Accident and Violation Evaluation Period is the 59-month 
period prior to current policy term inception or the date on which the driver is added to the policy, 
whichever is later. 
 
Extended Accident Evaluation Period - The Extended Accident Evaluation Period is the 83-month period 
prior to current policy term inception or the date on which the driver is added to the policy, whichever is 
later. 
 
Occurrence Date - The Occurrence Date is used to determine if the violation took place within the 
Accident and Violation Evaluation Period or if the accident took place within the Extended Accident 
Evaluation Period. If the date is not furnished on the application, the Occurrence Date will be deemed to

be the day before the inception date of the policy, unless the Company obtains another date from a 
consumer report (which it has no duty to obtain). For drivers added mid-term, if the violation or 
accident date is unknown or not provided, the Occurrence Date will be the day before the date the 
driver is added to the policy. 
 
Motor Vehicle Report (MVR)/Court Data/Claims Loss History Report Reconciliations - Accidents and 
violations listed on the application will be reconciled with similar accidents and violations obtained from 
a consumer report to avoid duplication. When reconciliation occurs, the accidents and violations will be 
assigned the date of occurrence listed on the consumer report. If reconciliation does not occur, 
accidents and violations listed on the application and/or the consumer report will be considered 
separate violations. 
 
Same Day Offenses - If an occurrence results in multiple violations or accidents that are assigned to the 
same driver, the driving record points for that occurrence will be based on the violation or accident with 
the highest Bodily Injury point charge. In the event that the same day offenses have the same Bodily 
Injury point charge, the offense occurring first alphabetically will be assigned the Bodily Injury point 
charge. 
 
Source of Points - Accidents or violations occurring while a driver is operating a private passenger auto, 
commercial vehicle, motorcycle, or recreational vehicle will be charged. Points for accidents and 
violations are charged per occurrence at the violation class level. 
 
Non-Novo Auto Accidents, Claims and Violations - Accidents, claims or violations that occurred prior to 
the driver becoming insured with the Company on the current policy. 
 
Novo Auto Accidents, Claims and Violations - Accidents, claims or violations that occurred after 
becoming insured with the Company on the current policy. If the current policy was rewritten with the 
Company with rewrite reason code O or C (Rule P76), accidents, claims or violations occurring on 
previously consecutive policies with the Company will be considered Novo Auto accidents or violations. 
Omitted incidents - Occurrences of AAF, MAJ, MIN, SPD, or DWI class codes for any eligible-to-be-rated 
driver that: 
1. 
Occurred before the driver was included on the policy; 
2. 
Occurred during the Chargeable Period for Points Assignment (Rule D04); and 
3. 
Are discovered on a consumer report but not disclosed by the applicant or by an insured. 
 
When an unlisted driver is discovered by the Company and added to the policy, prior occurrences for 
that driver discovered on a consumer report will be considered undisclosed omitted incidents and 
counted. 
 
At-fault Accidents: 
 
A. 
New Business and Newly Added Drivers - Accidents noted on the MVR, from court data, or 
on the application will be deemed to be at-fault unless proof is received to verify that the 
insured was not- at-fault. Accidents that occur on the same day as a moving violation will 
be considered at-fault. Accidents noted on the claims loss history report will be deemed

to be at-fault if payments were made under Liability or Collision coverage. However, if any 
Collision only claim has been closed without payment, or if amounts paid under Collision 
only claims have been subrogated, those accidents will be deemed to be not-at-fault. 
Accidents involving hitting another vehicle or object as a result of swerving to avoid an 
animal are at-fault. 
Accidents which are not considered to be at-fault include, but are not limited to, the 
following: 
1. 
The accident was caused by collision with a bird or animal; 
2. 
The automobile was lawfully parked; 
3. 
The automobile was struck in the rear by another vehicle and the driver of the 
automobile which was struck in the rear was not convicted of a moving violation in 
connection with the accident; 
4. 
The automobile was struck by a "hit-and-run" driver and the accident was reported 
to the proper authorities within 24 hours; 
5. 
The driver of the automobile was not convicted of a moving violation in connection 
with the accident, but the driver of another vehicle involved in the accident was 
convicted of a moving violation; or 
6. 
The driver was at-fault, but the accident is not chargeable under applicable state 
laws and regulations or other Company procedures. 
 
B. 
Renewal Business - Accidents reported to the Company will be deemed as a Novo 
Auto at-fault if we determine our insured is at least 51% liable for the accident. 
Accidents reported for a driver not listed on the policy will be classified as permissive 
use. Newly discovered accidents noted only on an MVR or from court data when 
obtained at renewal will be deemed non-chargeable. A newly discovered accident 
noted on the claims loss history report when obtained at renewal will be added if the 
accident did not occur with the Company and the driver was at-fault. 
Emergency Vehicle Operation – If the Company is notified of the circumstances of an accident by the 
applicant or insured, accidents occurring while a driver is operating an emergency vehicle (including, 
without limitation, an ambulance, police car, EMS vehicle, or fire department vehicle) in the line of duty 
will not be considered as part of the driving record. 
 
Mid-term Driving History Re-evaluation - At the named insured’s request during a policy term, the 
Company will re-evaluate the driving history of all drivers on the policy by removing points associated 
with accidents and violations that occurred more than 35 months prior to the date of re-evaluation if 
none of the drivers have had new accidents or violations since the premium for that policy term was 
determined. The policy premium shall be adjusted accordingly, as of the date of the named insured’s 
request, based on the revised point total. 
 
Clean Driver Classification - Drivers with zero BI/PD points are classified as "Clean" drivers. 
 
Speeding violations less than or equal to 65MPH in a 55MPH zone are not chargeable per Arizona law.

Clean at Inception - To be considered Clean at Inception, there must be no violations during the Accident 
and Violation Evaluation Period, no claims during the Extended Accident Evaluation Period and zero 
BI/PD points for all eligible-to-be-rated drivers (Rule D01) at new business policy inception.  
 
For purposes of this rule, Not-at-fault Accidents (NAF) and Comprehensive claims that are not permitted 
for use in rating will not be included in the Clean at Inception determination.
