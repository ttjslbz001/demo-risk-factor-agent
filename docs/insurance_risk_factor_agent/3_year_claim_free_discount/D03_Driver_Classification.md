D03 Driver Classification 
Driver Age refers to the age in years attained at the driver's last birthday before being included on the 
policy. If a driver is aged 24 or younger and has a birth date within 30 days after being included on the 
policy, use the higher age and their number of months since last birthday will be treated as zero.  For all 
other drivers, we will compute the actual number of months between the date the driver was added to 
the policy and their last birthday. 
 
When a driver's age is incremented, the number of years the driver has been licensed will also be 
incremented.   
 
For drivers with a Permit License (Rule D02), years licensed is set to 0 and will not increment until the 
driver's status is changed.   
 
Marital status is defined as follows: 
 
Single - A driver who is not married, as defined below. 
 
Married - A driver who is legally married, or who is deemed married pursuant to state laws, but not 
including a driver who is legally separated. (The inability of married persons to live together because of 
career obligations or military service does not deny them the married classification.)  
 
Widow/Widower â€“ A driver who was legally married, but whose spouse is deceased. Widowed 
operators are rated as single. However, if a married driver becomes widowed during a Company policy 
term, the driver will be rated as married for the balance of that term and all subsequent renewal policy 
terms.
