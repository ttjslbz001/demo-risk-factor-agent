P20 Financial Responsibility 
A. 
Rules of Ordering 
 
Credit is ordered on the primary named insured (PNI) if “eligible”. 
 
If the PNI is not eligible, or the credit order on the PNI driver results in a no- hit or thin 
file, then credit is ordered on an eligible spouse, if any. 
 
A PNI/spouse is “eligible” if at least 19 years of age and is an eligible to be rated driver 
(rule D01). 
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if credit was previously ordered on the PNI or spouse 
for a company program administered by Novo Insurance, it may be used in lieu of a 
new credit order on either the PNI or spouse, for a period not to exceed 90 days from 
the date it was ordered. 
 
If, after executing the provisions of this rule, the Company obtains a no hit or a thin file 
on the PNI or spouse, if applicable, or if the credit report vendor’s system is down, then 
the Company will attempt to obtain a credit report in accordance with the provisions of 
this rule from a secondary credit report vendor.

B. 
Hierarchy of Use 
 
If credit is ordered on the PNI and a credit report that is not a thin file is obtained, then 
information from that credit report is used to determine the financial responsibility 
score and the Financial Responsibility Tier. 
 
If credit is ordered on a spouse and a credit report that is not a thin file is obtained, then information 
from that credit report is used to determine the financial responsibility score and the Financial 
Responsibility Tier.

the spouse’s credit order is a no hit or thin file, then the spouse’s 
credit order status as no hit or thin file, and the spouse’s age, are used

order status as thin file, and the PNI's age, are used to determine the 
Financial Responsibility Tier. 
 
D. 
Proprietary Credit Score 
 
The Company’s proprietary credit score, used to determine the Financial Responsibility 
Tier except when Special Rules apply, is calculated by applying information from the 
applicable credit report to the following criteria: 
 
1. 
Satisfactory Trade Count - the number of trade lines that are open and have a 
satisfactory current payment status. 
2. 
Open High Credit Ratio - the percentage of credit that is outstanding on open 
trade lines. 
3. 
Trade Age - the length of time since the consumer’s reported trade lines were 
opened, adjusted for the consumer's age. The following trade lines are 
excluded from being used to determine trade age. 
• 
All trade lines that appear on the credit report as being in collection; 
and 
• 
All trade lines opened before the age of 16. 
4. 
Reported Auto Trades - the number and timing of reported auto trade lines. 
5. 
Collection Count - the number of collections. 
6. 
Delinquencies – the timing and severity of delinquent payments 
7. 
Trade Counts – the number of open and closed accounts.  
 
Regarding (1) through (7) above - certain types of trade lines and collection accounts 
are not eligible for scoring, such as, if the credit report identifies them as disputed or 
related to medical industry code or associated bankruptcy or lien satisfaction. 
 
8. 
The number and timing of inquiries, excluding: 
• 
Credit inquiries not initiated by the consumer (e.g., promotional or 
account review inquiries); 
• 
Inquiries requested by the consumer for his or her own credit information; 
• 
Inquiries relating to insurance coverage, if so identified on a consumer’s 
credit report; 
• 
All but one lender inquiry, within an inquiry type grouping, when made 
within 30 days of one another. The inquiry type groupings are: (1) the 
home mortgage industry; (2) the automobile lending industry; and (3) 
those not from the home mortgage or automobile lending industries. 
 
E. 
No-Hits and Thin Files 
 
A No-Hit occurs on a person when, upon request, a credit vendor does not return a 
credit report on such person in response to the Company’s standard request. No- Hits 
are classified into Financial Responsibility Tiers based on the age of the named insured 
or spouse.

A Thin File is a credit report that does not contain one or more eligible trade 
lines, inquiries or collection accounts. 
 
Thin Files are classified into Financial Responsibility Tiers based on the age of the 
named insured or spouse.  
 
Trade lines and collection accounts are not considered if the credit report identifies 
them as: 
• disputed; 
• credit card lost or stolen; 
• business/commercial accounts or loans; 
• authorized user accounts; 
• collection accounts relating to medical treatment. 
 
Furthermore, trade lines and collection accounts are not considered if the individual 
who is the subject of the trade line or collection account has been reported as 
deceased.

The FR Tier is determined based on the insurance scoring methodology and the Financial Responsibility 
Tier Table matrix in use at the time the FR Tier is first determined or when it is re-determined in 
accordance with Rule P22. Accordingly, policies in force on the effective date of this rule will continue 
to have the FR Tier previously assigned to them until their FR Tier is re-determined in accordance with 
Rule P22.
