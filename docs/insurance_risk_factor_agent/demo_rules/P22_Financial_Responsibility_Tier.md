P22 Financial Responsibility Tier 
A. 
Financial Responsibility Tier is assigned based on the applicable credit score in accordance 
with Rule P20. Once the Financial Responsibility Tier is determined, that tier shall be used for 
subsequent renewal terms unless a credit report is re- ordered and applied pursuant to 
Section B below. 
 
B. 
At the request of the named insured or his authorized agent, or a consent order, the Company 
shall re-order credit information, recalculate the insurance score, and evaluate the insurance 
score to determine if it would place the policy in a different financial responsibility tier (based 
on the BI/PD financial responsibility tier factor). If the new financial responsibility tier is a better 
tier, the insured will be placed in that tier. If the new financial responsibility tier is a worse tier, 
the tier will not change.  
 
The named insured or his authorized agent may not, however, make such a request more often than 
once in any 12-month period.
